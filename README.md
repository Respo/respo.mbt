# Respo in Moonbit(Early Stage)

> tiny toy virtual DOM library ported from [Respo.rs](https://github.com/Respo/respo.rs).

- Docs https://mooncakes.io/docs/#/tiye/respo/
- Live Demo https://repo.respo-mvc.org/respo.mbt

Core ideas:

- states are stored in a single atom, which is a tree structure, has concept like `cursor`
- uni-directional data flow, dispatching is only allowed during user events
- types as hints for DOM DSL.

This project is in early stage, APIs and structure may change.

### Usage

```bash
moon add tiye/respo
```
